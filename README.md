# NHL_API

Summary: This library contains python functions to extract data from the NHL's official stats API. In most cases, the functions return data in a pandas Dataframe. 

All functions are stored in the file 'functions.py' (see description below).

Files with names beginning with 'db_' are used to either create or update tables in a MySQL database.   


## functions.py 
Contains several functions that extract player and game statistics data from the NHL's API, which can be found at https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/ {followed by a specific GET request} OR http://www.nhl.com/stats/rest/skaters? {followed by a specific GET request}.

__
date_range(start_date, end_date)

- Input a start_date and end_date [e.g., date_range('YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY-MM-DD')].
- Function will return a list in order of all dates between 'start_date' and 'end_date' in YYYY-MM-DD string format.

__
get_adv_stats(start_date, end_date)

- Input a start_date and end_date ('YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY-MM-DD').
- Function will return a 94 different advanced stats metrics for each skater (goalies excluded), from each game, within the defined date range. 
- Each game will return a dataframe with each skater as a row and the 94 skater metrics as columns. 
- Data from all games are appended into a single dataframe.   

__
get_games(start_date, end_date)

- Input a start_date and end_date ('YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY-MM-DD').
- Function will return all gameIDs (e.g., 2017020001) from the defined date range. 

__
get_games_yest()

- Function will return a list of all gameIDs from the day before.
- This is particularly useful for updating a database with game data on a daily basis.

__
get_game_data(gameID)

- Input a gameID (e.g., 2017020001).
- Function will return a single dataframe containing all basic stats (goals, assists, PIMs, TOI, etc...) for all skaters (home and away).

__
repl_rosterID(df,rosterIDs)

- Input a dataframe and the name of a column containing rosterIDs. 
- Function will return the exact same dataframe with the rosterIDs column converted into player names (firstNameLastName).

__
convert_times(df,col_name)

- Input a dataframe and the name of a column (col_name) where time is represented in a MM:SS format.
- Function will return the exact same dataframe with the time column converted to a HH:MM:SS time format. 

__
covert_times_S_DT(df,col_name)

- Input a datafame and the name of a column (col_name) where time is represented in seconds.
- Function will return the exact same dataframe with the time column converted to a HH:MM:SS time format.

__
convert_IDs(df,col_name)

- Input a dataframe and the name of a column (col_name) where IDs are in a numeric format.
- Function will return the exact same datafram with col_name converted to a string format.

__
get_player_GBG_data(start_date,end_date)

- Input a start_date and end_date ('YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY-MM-DD').
- Function will return basic player stats (using the get_game_data function) in a single appended dataframe for all games within the date range.

__
get_player_GBG_data_yest()

- Function will return basic player game statistics (using teh get_game_data function) in a single appended dataframe for all games from the previous day.
 Â 
__
get_event_data(gameID)

- Input a gameID (e.g., 2017020001)
- Function will return a dataframe containing information about all major events (shots, hits, faceoffs, goals, missedshots, blockedshots, etc...) from the specified game

__
get_event_data(yest)

- Function will return a single dataframe containing information about all major events (shots, hits, faceoffs, goals, missedshots, blockedshots, etc...) from all games of the previous day

__
get_event_data_daterange(start_date,end_date)

- Input a start_date and end_date ('YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY-MM-DD').
- Function will return a TUPLE 
- the first object is a dataframe containing information about all major events (shots, hits, faceoffs, goals, missedshots, blockedshots, etc...) from all games in the defined date range.
- the second object is a list of all games where the API request came back empty

NOTE: there are some games where the event data is not returned from the API request. I haven't figured out why. This is missing data...

__
get_player_info(playerID)

- Input a 7 digit player ID (eg. ).
- Function will return a dataframe containing basic player information.
